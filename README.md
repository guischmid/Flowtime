# Flowtime for macOS

A simple, beautiful menu bar app for macOS based on the Flowtime Technique. This is a small side project built to learn SwiftUI and create a useful productivity tool. It helps you focus by tracking your work sessions and suggesting natural break times, allowing you to stay in the zone without the rigid constraints of a Pomodoro timer.

## What is the Flowtime Technique?

Flowtime is a flexible productivity method. Instead of rigid timers, you work until you feel a natural stopping point and then take a break. This app automates the process, letting you focus on your work, not the clock.

## Features

* **üçÖ State-Aware Menu Bar Icon:** The app's icon changes to let you know your current state at a glance.
* **üìà Dynamic Timer:** The elapsed work time or remaining break time is displayed directly in the menu bar.
* **üîß Customizable Break Rules:** Adjust the break calculation rules to fit your personal workflow.
* **‚å®Ô∏è Global Keyboard Shortcut:** Start or stop the timer from anywhere in macOS.
* **üöÄ Launch at Login:** Automatically start Flowtime when you log in to your Mac.
* **üîî Sound Notifications:** Optional audio cues for session start and break end.

## Future Ideas

This project is a work in progress. Here are some potential features and fixes for the future:

* **Task Naming:** Ability to name or tag your focus sessions.
* **Session History:** A log or simple chart to review your work patterns.
* **UI Polish:** Refine animations and spacing for a cleaner look.
* **Advanced Notifications:** Add more notification options, like a warning before a break ends.
